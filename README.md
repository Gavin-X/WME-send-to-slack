## Current Version of the script ##
Check here : https://wmests.bowlman.org

## What does this script do?
It sends requests to Lock, Downlock, Close, Open, and Validate segments directly from WME to a communication platform  

At this moment, the requests can be sent to Slack, Discord, Telegram, and a GForm.

## What's new ?
* This script currently supports 20 countries and is continuously growing
* This script now includes Restricted areas.
* This script now supports States (USA added)
* This script now supports Telegram (thanks to santyg2001)
* Sending to a GForm helps promotion decisions at L1-L3 (thanks to BertZZZZ)

## Installation
The script works best with browsers Brave, Chrome, Firefox (not with Internet explorer or Edge). I recommend Brave  
Like most of the scripts used by Waze editors, it needs a script manager like Tampermonkey   
Then, install the latest version

## How to use
First, select the country, state, and channel in settings. You can find it on the tab with the colored wheel in the left menu. If you don't see the colored wheel, reload the page with WME open.  
After selecting one or more segments, you'll see some extra icons:

### Validation
The Validation link is on top of the left column just above the settings tab

### Lock / Downlock
The Lock and Downlock links are below the locking option in the general menu

### Close / Open
The Closure and Open links are on the Closure Tab. You need to enable the closure layer to view them

### Restricted areas?
The restricted areas are now supported

## About the script
